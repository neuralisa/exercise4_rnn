New homework is about machine translation.
Please have a look at the following tutorial:

Download the german to english dictionary from here:

Your task is to adapt the code to create a German to English translator and modify the model to use GLOVE embeddings.
Make any changes to the model and we will compare next week on a test dataset that I will present. 
The objective is to get the best possible BLEU score.
