New homework is about machine translation.
Please have a look at the following tutorial:
https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html

Your task is to adapt the code to create a German to English translator. 
1. Download the german to english dataset
2. Split the overall into train/val/test datasets
3. Train the model
4. Evaluate the model using BLEU/SacreBLEU metric

Download the german to english dictionary from here:
https://tatoeba.org/en/downloads

Optional:  Use german vector embeddings.
You can find vector embeddings for the german language here:https://github.com/bheinzerling/bpemb?tab=readme-ov-file#downloads-for-each-language. 
Make any changes to the model and we will compare next week on a test dataset that I will present. 
The objective is to get the best possible BLEU score.
